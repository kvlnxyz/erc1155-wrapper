# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Has anyone ever created an ERC1155 token wrapper? i.e. a contract that,

# when you send ERC20 tokens to it, issues an ERC1155 token with a tokenID

# given by the address of the ERC20 token and a balance equal to the sent amount?
